# Bangalore Weather Forecast - 33 Years Data
# Project Overview
This project visualizes and analyzes weather data for Bangalore, India, over the past 33 years. The goal is to explore historical weather patterns, including temperature and rainfall, to predict trends and provide insights into how the weather in Bangalore has evolved over the years.

The project leverages Power BI for interactive dashboards that allow users to explore temperature trends, rainfall variations, and the impact of seasonal shifts on the weather in Bangalore.

# Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from an Excel file containing weather data for Bangalore over the past 33 years. The dataset includes the following key weather parameters:

Date (Year and Month)
Max Temperature (°C)
Min Temperature (°C)
Average Temperature (°C)
Rainfall (mm)

# Excel File Structure:
The Excel file consists of the following sheets:

Sheet1 (Weather Data): Contains the weather data with columns for Year, Month, Max Temperature, Min Temperature, Rainfall, and Average Temperature.
Key Features
Yearly Trends: Visualize yearly trends of max and min temperatures and rainfall across the 33 years of data.
Seasonal Insights: Understand how the monsoon season and dry seasons affect the temperature and rainfall patterns in Bangalore.
Rainfall & Temperature: Compare rainfall intensity with temperature fluctuations in different months and years.
Interactive Visualizations: Use filters and slicers to drill down into the weather data based on specific years, months, or weather conditions.
Key Visualizations
Line Graphs: Display temperature and rainfall trends over the 33 years.
Bar Charts: Compare average temperature and rainfall across years.
Heatmap: Visualize the seasonal variation in temperatures and rainfall for each month.
Scatter Plots: Analyze the relationship between temperature and rainfall.
Insights
Temperature Trends: An increasing trend in both max and min temperatures over the years, with noticeable seasonal variations.
Rainfall Patterns: Analysis of Bangalore’s monsoon seasons and variations in rainfall patterns across different years.
Seasonal Shifts: Seasonal weather shifts that affect temperature and rainfall, especially during the monsoon.

# How to Use
Download and open the Bangalore_Weather_33_Years.pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
Use the slicers to filter data based on specific months, years, or weather conditions.
Hover over visualizations for detailed tooltips or use the filters to narrow down data.
Interact with charts to gain insights into trends over time and their seasonal impacts.

# Dependencies
Power BI Desktop: Version 2.87.1711.1081 or later.
Weather Data Excel File: Ensure the Bangalore_Weather_33_Years.xlsx file is available and contains necessary data for Bangalore.

# Challenges Faced
Missing Data: Some weather entries were incomplete or missing, requiring cleaning and interpolation for accuracy.
Data Granularity: The dataset’s granularity required aggregation and seasonal analysis to provide meaningful insights for Bangalore’s overall weather trends.
Future Enhancements
Predictive Modeling: Add predictive models like ARIMA or regression analysis to forecast future weather conditions in Bangalore.
Geospatial Visualizations: Incorporate maps to show how weather patterns are distributed across different areas of Bangalore.
Real-Time Data Integration: Integrate real-time weather data via APIs (e.g., OpenWeather) to compare historical and current weather conditions.
